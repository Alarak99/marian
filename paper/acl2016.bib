  abstract = {We describe Phrasal Rank-Encoding (PR-Enc), a novel method for the
  compression of word-aligned target language data in phrase tables as used in
  phrase-based SMT. This method reduces the redundancy in phrase tables which is
  a direct effect of the phrase-based approach. A combination of PR-Enc with
  Huffman coding allows to reduce the size of an aggressively compressed phrase
  table by another 39 percent. Using this and other methods for space reduction
  in a new binary phrase table implementation, a size reduction by an order of
  magnitude is achieved when comparing to the Moses on-disk phrase table
  implementation. Concerning decoding speed, all variants of the new phrase
  table are faster than the Moses binary phrase table implementation while the
  PR-Enc encoded variant outperforms all other methods.}

  is intended for experienced language engineers as well as casual users not
  having any technological background. The former group of users is delivered a
  set of libraries that may be included in their Perl, Python or Java
  applications. The needs of the latter group should be satisfied by a user
  friendly web interface. The main feature of the toolkit is its data structure,
  the so-called PSI-lattice that assembles annotations delivered by all PSI
  tools. This cohesive architecture allows the user to invoke a series of
  processes with one command. The command has the form of a pipeline of
  instructions resembling shell command pipelines known from Linux-based
  system.}
